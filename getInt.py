# Task 4 â€“ Input an Integer Between Two Limits
# In this part you&#39;ll ask the user to input an integer between a minimum and maximum values.
# If the user fails to enter an acceptable value for three times then you stop asking!
# 1. Add a new file: getInt.py and make it the startup file.
# 2. Create two variables for the min and max values.
# Set two values for these variables such as 1 and 100.
# 3. Write a while loop that attempts to get an integer from the user between the limits of
# min and max values.
# 4. If the user has tried three times and fails then print None.
# If a valid value is entered, just end the loop and print its value.
# Note: None is a valid keyword in Python which stands for Null.

minimum = 1
maximum = 100
counter = 1



while counter <= 3:
  value = int(input("Enter a number between 1 and 100: "))
  if value >= minimum and value <= maximum:
    print(value)
    break
  
  elif counter < 3:
    counter += 1
    print (f"{3 - counter} attempts left")

  elif counter == 3:
    print ("None")
